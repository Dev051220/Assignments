A DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter is a component of a database management system (DBMS) responsible for processing and executing DDL statements. DDL statements are used to define, modify, and manage the structure and schema of a database. Common DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.

The DDL interpreter parses DDL statements provided by users or applications, checks their syntax and semantics, and then performs the necessary actions to implement the requested changes in the database schema. This may involve creating new database objects, modifying existing ones, or removing objects from the schema.

In addition to interpreting DDL statements, the DDL interpreter may also enforce certain rules and constraints defined by the database administrator or the database system itself. For example, it may enforce naming conventions, data type constraints, and referential integrity constraints specified in the DDL statements.

Overall, the DDL interpreter plays a crucial role in managing the structure of a database, ensuring that changes to the schema are correctly implemented and that the database remains consistent and functional.
